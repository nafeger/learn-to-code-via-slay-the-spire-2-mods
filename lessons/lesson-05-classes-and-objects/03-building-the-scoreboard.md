# 03 — Building the Scoreboard

Now you write a class from scratch. The `Scoreboard` is the simplest possible real class —
state plus behavior, nothing else — which makes it the perfect first one.

## What it needs to do

Stated plainly, a scoreboard for a best-of-three match:

1. Remembers how many rounds the player has won, the computer has won, and how many were
   draws.
2. Records the result of a round.
3. Reports whether someone has won the match (first to two).
4. Exposes the running counts so the event can show them to the player.

That description names the fields and the methods, exactly like the method-design process
in Lesson 4 — except now the data and the behavior live together in one class.

## Sharing the `Outcome` type

There is a snag to handle first. In Lesson 4, `Outcome` was declared *inside*
`RockPaperScissors`:

```csharp
private enum Outcome { Win, Lose, Draw }
```

The `Scoreboard` needs to talk about outcomes too — `Record` takes an `Outcome`. But a
`private` enum nested inside `RockPaperScissors` is not visible to other classes. When two
classes need to share a type, that type no longer belongs to just one of them — it moves
*out* to the namespace, where both can see it.

Create a small file, `src/StarterContent/events/RpsTypes.cs`, and move both enums there:

```csharp
namespace JacksMod;

public enum Choice { Rock, Paper, Scissors }
public enum Outcome { Win, Lose, Draw }
```

They were `private` and nested; now they are `public` and live at the namespace level.
("Namespace" is the `namespace JacksMod;` line at the top of every file — chapter 05 explains
it fully. For now, read it as "the shared space all your mod's types live in.") Delete the two
nested `enum` lines from `RockPaperScissors`. Nothing else about the event changes —
`Choice.Rock` and `Outcome.Win` still mean the same thing; they just live somewhere both the
event and the new classes can reach.

> This is a recurring pattern: a type starts life owned by one class, then a second class
> needs it, so it graduates to a shared location. Moving it is the right response, not a
> workaround.

## The Scoreboard class

Create `src/StarterContent/events/Scoreboard.cs`:

```csharp
namespace JacksMod;

public class Scoreboard
{
    private const int WINS_NEEDED = 2;   // best of three: first to two wins

    private int playerWins;
    private int computerWins;
    private int draws;

    public void Record(Outcome outcome)
    {
        if (outcome == Outcome.Win)       playerWins++;
        else if (outcome == Outcome.Lose) computerWins++;
        else                              draws++;
    }

    public bool PlayerWonMatch()   => playerWins   >= WINS_NEEDED;
    public bool ComputerWonMatch() => computerWins >= WINS_NEEDED;

    // Read-only views of the counts, so the event can display them.
    public int PlayerWins   => playerWins;
    public int ComputerWins => computerWins;
    public int Draws        => draws;

    public string Summary() =>
        $"Score — you: {playerWins}, opponent: {computerWins} (draws: {draws})";
}
```

Read it as state plus behavior:

- **State**: three private `int` fields, plus a `const` for the rule "first to two."
- **Behavior**: `Record` changes the state; `PlayerWonMatch`/`ComputerWonMatch` ask
  questions about it; the three `Wins`/`Draws` properties expose the counts read-only.

> **`Summary()` vs. what the player sees.** `Summary()` returns a plain, hard-coded English
> string. That is perfect for a `Console.WriteLine` or a debug log — and that is exactly what
> the console version of this game uses it for. But it can never be *translated*, so it is not
> what the game's UI shows. In the next chapter the event reads the raw counts
> (`PlayerWins`, `ComputerWins`, `Draws`) and feeds them into a localization key, which is the
> translatable path. Keep `Summary()` as a developer convenience; the player-facing text is
> built a different way.

### The pieces you have not seen as your own code

**Expression-bodied methods.** `public bool PlayerWonMatch() => playerWins >= WINS_NEEDED;`
is shorthand for a method whose whole body is one expression. It is identical to:

```csharp
public bool PlayerWonMatch()
{
    return playerWins >= WINS_NEEDED;
}
```

The `=>` form is the same thing the mod's own code uses — `CanonicalVars => [...]` in
`CoinFlip` is an expression-bodied member. Use whichever reads more clearly; for one-line
methods, `=>` is common.

**String interpolation.** `$"Score — you: {playerWins}, ..."` is an interpolated string.
The `$` in front lets you drop `{playerWins}` into the text and have its value substituted
in. You saw this exact feature in `CoinFlip`: `$"{base.Id.Entry}.headsBanter"`.

### Why `Record` controls everything

`Record` is the *only* way the counts change, and it is the only place that decides which
count an outcome maps to. Because the fields are private, no other code can increment
`playerWins` directly. If you later change the rules — say a draw secretly counts as half a
point for someone — you change `Record` and nowhere else. That is encapsulation paying off:
one class owns its data and the rules for changing it.

## Where does the scoreboard live?

A fair question to ask of any state: where does it actually *live*, and what happens to it
later? For this `Scoreboard`, the answer is **in memory** — the object exists in your
computer's RAM while the event is open, and when the run ends, it is gone. That is exactly
right here: a single match's score has no reason to outlive the match.

But "where does state live?" is a real spectrum, and the rungs are worth naming because you
will climb them in bigger programs:

- **In memory** (what you have) — fast, simple, and gone when the program stops. Right for
  transient things like one match's score.
- **In a file** — written to disk so it survives a restart. The game's own save system works
  this way, and so does the localization JSON you met in Lesson 4.
- **In a database** — a structured store built for large amounts of data that many readers
  query and search. Overkill for a scoreboard; the right tool once you have thousands of
  records you need to look things up in.

The mechanism is always the same shape: an object holds the *live* state in memory, and
"saving" means **copying that state out** to a file or database, then **reading it back** to
rebuild the object later. (Turning an object into bytes you can store is called
*serialization* — a "things to look up" for when you need it.) This curriculum stays in
memory; durable persistence is its own large topic. The habit to carry forward is the
question itself: when you build state, ask *"does this need to outlive the program — and if
so, where will it live?"*

## Trace it by hand

Before wiring it in, confirm you understand it. Walk a best-of-three where the player wins,
loses, then wins:

| Call | `playerWins` | `computerWins` | `draws` | `PlayerWonMatch()` |
|------|--------------|----------------|---------|--------------------|
| start | 0 | 0 | 0 | false |
| `Record(Outcome.Win)` | 1 | 0 | 0 | false |
| `Record(Outcome.Lose)` | 1 | 1 | 0 | false |
| `Record(Outcome.Win)` | 2 | 1 | 0 | **true** |

After the third round, `PlayerWonMatch()` returns `true` and the match is over. The object
remembered the running tally across three separate calls — which is the thing a lone method
could never do.

## Vocabulary

**Expression-bodied method** — A method written with `=>` when its body is a single
expression. `bool Done() => count >= 2;`

**String interpolation** — Building a string with `$"...{value}..."`, substituting values
inline.

**Single source of truth** — Keeping the rule for changing data in exactly one place
(here, `Record`), so a change has one home.

## Things to look up

- "C# string interpolation" — formatting numbers, alignment, the full syntax
- "C# expression-bodied members" — where `=>` is allowed
- "C# enum" — review from Lesson 4, now that enums live at namespace scope
- "C# serialization" — turning an object into bytes you can save to a file or database
